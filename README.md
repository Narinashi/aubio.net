# aubio.net

This is [aubio](https://github.com/aubio/aubio) for .NET Standard, it works for desktop apps as well as store apps.

All stable types are available as .NET types, leveraging features like LINQ, IEnumerable<T>, IDisposable, typed-approach etc.

It still needs some polishing so expect some minor adjustments to the API (read here it's not yet ready), for the documentation you will have to refer to https://aubio.org/documentation for the time being.

Your feedback is welcome !
